# Linux Kernel Headers for the R36S / R36H
These are (currently) the original Kernel headers (by christianhaitian) for the <strong>R36S</strong> and <strong>R36H</strong> which are from his official support intended for the RG351MP/RGB10X

These files are used/needed by the compiler(s) when making or building your own software, drivers and stuff like that on the R36S/R36H consoles.

If you are using <strong>ANY</strong> other device than the R36S or the R36H then please always use the original (and latest) headers from the original source:
https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/tree/main/Headers

If you're not a developer and are not installing (building!) custom drivers? Just stay away from these files, because you most likely won't ever need them ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‚

## Offline Installation
Obviously it could also be that you would need these files as 'offline installation' when you are still working on getting your wifi/ethernet card working with your R36S/R36H, so that's why you can also use these files with the XNL Package Manager and the Offline Installation Method. Just download all the files in this folder and copy all of them (except the readme.md) to your <strong>OS-TF-CARD</strong> (SDCARD 1!) into the following folder:
/roms/XNLDev/update

Then start the XNL Package Manager on your R36S/R36H and goto:
<strong>->Advanced Packages & Drivers ->Developer Options  Install Kernel Headers</strong>

After <strong>reading the information</strong> and confirming that you do want to install them you can then select option 4: <strong>Offline Install (/romd/XNLDev/update)</strong>

And the XNL Installation Wizard should do the rest

NOTE: The XNLDev needs to be made with the correct capitalization as shown, otherwise you might get issues when running the XNL Package Manager on your system! Most of the time this won't be an issue but just in case it is recommended to make sure the capitalization matches (this depends on the filesystem of your /roms folder and/or how the partition is mounted!)
