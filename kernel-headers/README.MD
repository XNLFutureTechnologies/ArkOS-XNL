# Linux Kernel Headers for the R36S / R36H
These are (currently) the original Kernel headers (by christianhaitian) for the <strong>R36S</strong> and <strong>R36H</strong> which are from his official support intended for the RG351MP/RGB10X

These files are used/needed by the compiler(s) when making or building your own software, drivers and stuff like that on the R36S/R36H consoles.

If you are using <strong>ANY</strong> other device than the R36S or the R36H then please always use the original (and latest) headers from the original source:

If you're not a developer and are not installing (building!) custom drivers? Just stay away from these files, because you most likely won't ever need them ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‚
