# Linux Kernel Headers for the R36S / R36H

These are (currently) the original Kernel headers (by christianhaitian) for the R36S and R36H which are from his official support intended for the RG351MP/RGB10X

If you are using ANY other device than the R36S or the R36H then please always use the original (and latest) headers from the original source:

If you're not a developer and are not installing (building!) custom drivers? Just stay away from these files, because you most likely won't ever need them ;)
