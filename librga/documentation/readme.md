This is the (Google) translated documentation from the documentation you can find on the original GitHub: https://github.com/christianhaitian/linux-rga  

I translated them using google, restored the table borders in the documentation (which where lost after translation and converting them to PDF), and then just re-uploaded them here so more people will be able to use the documentation if needed.
