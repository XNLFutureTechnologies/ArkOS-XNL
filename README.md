# ArkOS-XNL
XNL Future Technologies ArkOS additions, improvements and tools for the <strong>R36S</strong> and <strong>R36H</strong> while using the <strong>official ArkOS</strong> version (by christianhaitian)
Which can be found here: https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos

We personally prefer to use to official ArkOS version (instead of the community maintained version), and for that version I have also developed
(and am currently developing) some significant updates, tools, programs and more. Which will all will be available on my Github at a later point
when it's all done.

But to prepare for this (and while working on these programs) I need to have certain files online already 😉

Therefor this repository for the R36S / R36H XNL Addons

This repository also serves as a mirror/backup for certain files which are crucial to/for the XNL R36S/R36H Tool Kit and other programs I'm currently working on.

WARNING:
These files are specifically intended for the R36S and R36H consoles!
