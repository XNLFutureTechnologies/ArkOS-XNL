# IN DEVELOPMENT NOTE
Please note that certain sections of this repository (and thus the readme.md files in the folders) might (and will) reffer to certain tools, programs and scripts (like for example the <strong>XNL Package Manager</strong>), please realize that these tools are NOT online/published yet! I'm currently actively working on a <strong>MASSIVE</strong> Tool Kit for the R36S/R36H running on ArkOS, and to be able to properly test certain features of this toolkit I will have to publish some parts already, and while doing so I'm also preparing certain sections of this repository already for public use/release later on. So don't worry, the mentioning of those tools/programs etc is not a mistake, and neither did I forgot to upload or did I take down something. It's just not released yet ðŸ˜‰

# ArkOS-XNL
XNL Future Technologies ArkOS additions, improvements and tools for the <strong>R36S</strong> and <strong>R36H</strong> while using the <strong>official ArkOS</strong> version (by christianhaitian)
Which can be found here: https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos

We personally prefer to use to official ArkOS version (instead of the community maintained version), and for that version I have also developed
(and am currently developing) some significant updates, tools, programs and more. Which will all will be available on my Github at a later point
when it's all done.

But to prepare for this (and while working on these programs) I need to have certain files online already ðŸ˜‰

Therefor this repository for the R36S / R36H XNL Addons

This repository also serves as a mirror/backup for certain files which are crucial to/for the XNL R36S/R36H Tool Kit and other programs I'm currently working on.

WARNING:
These files are specifically intended for the R36S and R36H consoles!
